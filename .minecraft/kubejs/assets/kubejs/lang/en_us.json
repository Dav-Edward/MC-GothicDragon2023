The main problem with such connections was the division of the soul. When an elemental connected with someone, he transmitted its experience. Due to the many other Elementals memories in their head, it becomes impossible for adult beings with many thoughts of their own to think and realize who they are. Over time, ways have been found to deal with this and even combine several elementals at once. Immortal beings appeared who could easily abstract themselves from any other peoples knowledge, transfer their souls between bodies and, if necessary, die without any harm to themselves. As a result, many types of mystical creatures appeared, composed of lava, water, metals and everything else around. They took on a desired or familiar appearance and were capable of breathing fire, levitating, teleporting or using any other type of magic. It was at this point, a new magical class of creatures appeared - the Elemental Creatures. They combined the living and inanimate nature. One of such creatures became the Dragon.\n",

This is an eventful story, but right now we are only interested in one of the descendants of those first dragons who appeared with the help of elementals. He was born in the world of lava, among the fiery wastelands, and was born from an egg along with others. Young dragons grew up, learned magic and began to independently explore the world, and eventually space. Brothers and sisters were divided. \n\n■ Many centuries later, one of them found and made a part of himself three other elementals - Gold, Diamond and Water. They were found in an interesting world that consisted entirely of huge immortal trees. Among this green cover were huge acid lakes that exposed all layers of this dense forest to the very depths of the earth. Here it was perfectly visible what this huge forest consisted of. The bottom of these lakes was completely covered with large diamonds and obsidian. Unusual poisonous elementals floated on the surface, drawing their power from sunlight. \n\n■ The upper tier had many shades of green and was blindingly bright. Due to the thinness of the air, it was difficult to breathe there. The border of the upper tier was the crown of the trees - their branches and leaves. Large bowls of fresh water were formed in them, which could penetrate the entire forest. It was there, under the open sky, that the healing elemental lived, helping every creature that came, if he sacrificed a part of his experience.\n\n■ The middle tier consisted of intricate wooden caves. Much of the foliage here was yellow and red due to the lack of light. The suns rays were still there, but this place was quickly overgrown with other plants. The local fruits smelled strongly and were able to glow to lure numerous creatures. There were a great many of them in the middle tier. They were the ones who made holes in the beautiful green carpet and gave life to other plants.\n\n■ The lower tier was the abode of monsters. There was only absolute darkness among the huge tree trunks, punctuated by occasional lakes of lava. There was nothing here except for wooden-stone smooth columns and half-blind monsters that hunted each other and waited for someone careless to fall from above. The entire floor of this tier consisted of the strongest, sharpest roots that went very deep into the lava depths of the planet. Once upon a time, the trees swallowed up all the soil and made it part of themselves. They left untouched only obsidian and numerous ores, among which was much gold and corresponding elementals. They absorbed much of the suffering of the place and developed a keen sense of compassion that became anger in especially hard times. The great golden elementals were capable of attracting lightning, which destroyed the forest to its roots.\n",

 "chapter.1.quest.32.description.1": "\n■ It was difficult to combine such incompatible materials in his lava body, but thanks to its enormous size and magical power, he succeeded. And he called himself Neldmont, in honor of the main elementals of which he consisted - netherite, gold and diamonds. For many years he lived in this green world and, unfortunately, destroyed most of the forest due to his fiery nature. Like most other old dragons, Neldmont longed to explore the world beyond his planet, gathering unique knowledge and spreading descendants in other dimensions. \n\n■ In one dimension, he found a previously unknown type of Star Elementals, the main feature of which was the ability to transform living beings into skeletons and teleport, transferring the experience orbs over a great distance. The elemental looked like a glowing white cube surrounded by black haze and orbs of experience. Touching them was often fatal. In an aggressive state, the elemental teleported erratically, but could not see or feel anything. To do this, he needed a strong outer shell - a skeleton. \n\n■ Neldmont did not understand what exactly he had found, and while the portal was open, some of them fled. They began to turn everyone into magical predators. At some point, they were even able to defeat one of Neldmonts children, who was traveling with him. It was clear that sooner or later they would have gained enough strength to kill even their liberator. He did not want to destroy another world and believed that he had lived a fairly good and long life.\n\n■ The huge Neldmont had to split himself into many skeletal dragons, creating an army from his body. They contained all his magic, knowledge and power, collected over the long millennials. They chased and killed the magical predators. Most of them died, and the rest were locked together with their liberator in one of the cosmic dimensions. There was no way out of it. From Neldmont there was only a little dragon who remembered practically nothing. \n",

 "chapter.1.quest.33.description.1": "\n■ 1. Egg. \n■ Can look quite different for each species. The size ranges go from large chicken egg to ostrich egg, depending on the size of the parents. The egg develops inside the female or male, but can always leave it at the will of the parent and has no specific location in the body. If for some reason it loses its parents, it can survive on its own, but with a lower chance. If someone tries to eat such an egg, they are guaranteed to die from infection by an alien spirit. Dragons transformed through the altar do not have this stage, but they can become parents themselves in the future. To do so, the two dragons must sacrifice part of their experience spheres and merge them.\n\n■ 2. Newborn dragon. \n■ Dragons born from a dragon egg have an important feature - they have no skin and have very little life force. Therefore, the main goal of the dragon during this stage of his development is to gather building materials. To do this, the newborn seeks all possible sources and actively explores the world near his parents. There is active growth and creation of a new element. While it has a small size and much in common with his parents, it can hide inside their bodies without harm. Later it becomes complicated due to increasing intolerance between the elements. If a newborn has to survive without his parents, it has to go to various tricks for the sake of disguise. For example, carrying a protective shell from another creature or any other natural material in which it can hide. Depending on the environment, the dragons appearance slowly changes as well. For those who transform into a dragon with an altar they don’t have such problem. They transform their pre-existing body into a new skin, however they still need to collect the finished magical elements.\n\n■ 3. Young dragon. \n■ This stage begins when the dragon is strong enough to begin an independent life. At this stage, he can leave his parents and tread peacefully in the world without the fear that a little rain or a small drought will kill him. If the dragon consists of several elements, they have to choose which one to develop next. Quite commonly they continue to stay with their family and form large dragon tribes, but not all of them are happy with such a fate. There are also those who prefer solitude.\n\n■ 4. Adult dragon. \n■ A dragon becomes an adult when it has accumulated enough strength and in alliance with another dragon can create a family. As with magic, for a new magical life, you need to invest in a lot of experience orbs. Only really large individuals are capable of this. Dragons spend most of their time at this stage, accumulating treasures and knowledge. Their life can end for many reasons - magical illnesses, physical trauma, exhaustion, etc. Those dragons that descended from the Immortals were deprived of natural death and were reborn, but could still completely lose their freedom and power. From too many injuries (of any nature), they could go into hibernation.\n\n■ 5. Elder dragon.\n■ These are some of the first dragons that emerged from elementals a long time ago. There are very few dragons of this size and age in the whole world. Most of those living today have their descendants. They are not in any danger, except for other ancient creatures. These dragons overcame death and are able to renew the magical elements that decay with old age. There have often many other dragons around them, who communicate with the Ancient One and exchange his knowledge and magic for the found elements. Some of them founded their own wandering cities, but among them there are still loners sleeping in endless space.\n",

The earth swallowed up the bodies of all the skeleton dragons and magical predators, turning the memories of that battle into various fossils. On the cleared land, an intelligent civilization was restored, which was in decline due to the magical predators and dragons. The found bones of Neldmont were used in rituals and in some temple decorations. In the absolute silence, the quiet echo of space could be heard emanating from the elder bones. It came from a three-headed dragon that grew from what was left of Neldmont. His soul was divided into an army of dragon-skeletons. An ancient instinct for self-preservation prevented the last 3 dragons from completing the process and they remained as one, subsequently naming themselves Tress. This dragonborn remembered almost nothing of his past, except basic things like language, basic survival, and reacquainted himself with the world in which he was trapped. There was nothing there to help restore his memory. On the yellow islands hovering in space were only the black humanoid creatures he hunted and the living skeletons. \n\n■ The skeletal dragons created from Neldmonts body perished and lay next to the remains of magical predators for centuries. This proximity could not pass unnoticed because of the transformation magic contained within the star elemental. If previously the bones of the ancient dragon had once transmitted their power and memories to the finder, now a Star Mark was also imprinted on it. It informed the ancient dragon about the location of such dragons and didnt allow them to reveal their magic potential - only 1-2 elements and corresponding magic were available, they couldnt fly because of the lack of levitation and create other dragons as the ancient dragon was able to do. Some of the spheres of experience and knowledge were also transferred to their rightful owner, but some of it were still lost forever. Thus appeared 3 kinds of dragons that we know now. \n\n■ The surviving magical predators were also completely transformed and reborn. They absorbed the knowledge of the elder dragon and were tamed. Due to the fact that now there was a skeleton made of Neldmont bones around the star, they saw Tress as their master. He grew up with them and they protected him as their little brother. They had a strong emotional bond with each other, and for Tress they were his only friends in this empty and cold space. One day he found one of his own bones with memories among the sharp yellow stones. It was with its help that the little dragon was able to restore part of himself and his memories. So he learned that he was a huge dragon, whose bones can still be found in other worlds. They contained his power and he wanted to get it back. The main obstacle for him was a closed portal to other worlds, which can only be opened from the other side.\n",

He could now create the undead from other creatures and found a way to find out what was happening in the world. The very temples and artifacts richly decorated with his bones found the voice of Tress. An Ancient Dragon cult formed around them, aiming to collect the unusual remains of this lizard-like deity. And one day there were so many artifacts that they gained life and turned members of the cult into strong dragons. A quiet voice asked to free the deity from his imprisonment. They learned who he was and what had happened in the distant past. There was much debate within the cult about this request and what happened because of the magical predators that were now with Tress. They were not convinced by his words about the safety of these creatures. Many felt that he just wanted to use them. The magic that bound the cultists gradually faded and in time they stopped hearing him altogether. \n\n■ The dragon-turned-cultists were divided. They no longer worshiped the Elder Dragon, seeing it as a danger somewhere on the edge of the universe. Many of them began destroying the bones they found, turning them into magical power with which they could burn with fire, strike with lightning, and poison without restraint. Everyone around them watched in horror as those went mad in pursuit of power and plunged the world into chaos. Slavery, murder, and impunity flourished. These dragons did not care at all about the future or any rebellion. They could destroy everyone in the blink of an eye. Thus began the era of the Blood Dragon Cultists, which created legends about the bloodthirstiness of dragons, which were passed down from generation to generation for centuries, perpetuating the fear of these creatures.\n\n■ In the destroyed cult, there was one who remembered the lonely dragon trapped at the edge of the universe - Zarus. A green dragon with diamond plates on its chest and bright purple eyes. It was her who found the way to the trapped three-headed dragon and opened the portal. What Tress learned made him terribly angry. The bones the cultists have destroyed for the sake of magical power were his last hope for recovering his original appearance. Along with Zarus, he went back and attacked the dragon cultists with all of his magical predators. It was a long bloody battle, and most of the tyrants died, returning what little was left to their rightful owner. \n\n■ After this story, Tress searched for ancient shards in the company of magical predators and Zarus all over the world. Finding precious dust among the gray stones was difficult. Everything on the surface had long since been looted. Only the deepest bowels of the earth preserved the remains. Those who were far removed from dragons had to work hard to find the first accumulations of dust that had not yet disintegrated into separate spheres of experience from their touch. In most cases, the dust is absorbed along with the experience orbs without even noticing it. He removed the restraining Star Mark from her, and from then on they could fly together and use magic. The green dragon had a lot to say about this rich world. Accustomed to the space void, Tress was unaccustomed to the singing of birds, the murmuring of water, and the many animals around, which he tried to turn into the undead at every opportunity. Fortunately, there was also the food he was used to. In the past, he had only hunted tall black creatures, which made him look like them himself, and he adopted the ability to teleport. Tress was able to use this ability as well as predators. Most likely, they too were able to use this magic in the distant past because of a similar diet.\n",

 "chapter.1.quest.36.description.1": "\n■ Over the course of their journey, the two dragons grew closer. Zarus took care of Tress and protected him from all dangers. This softened the elder dragons heavy heart and a smile began to appear on his face. Like any story, this one couldnt last forever. Cultists were not the only ones who wished to become a dragon. Some simply admired the creatures, some wanted their power, and some considered themselves trapped in another creatures body as a dragon. In one way or another, more and more new dragons appeared in the world, hearing that with the help of magical bones it was possible to turn into them. To avoid a repeat of history with the Blood Cultists and the destruction of his past, Tress sent magical predators to kill these dragons and return the stolen goods. The more often he did this, the more Zarus distanced herself from him. She did not find it necessary to kill every newborn dragon in the world, though she understood why they did it. For years the green dragoness had turned a blind eye to this hunt, but when magical predators killed a small family she knew, temporarily becoming dragons to feed themselves, her heart could not stand it. All the power of the world was not worth the bloodshed to continue and attempts to explain it were futile. His memories of the cultists were too strong.\n\n■ She lured Tress under the guise of walking into the cosmic dimension and magically locked him there. The spell did not allow the ancient dragon to approach the portal closer than several tens of kilometers. It was a difficult choice, but no one, except Zarus, could stop what was happening. The predators could still overcome the created barrier and pass through the portal, following the orders of the ancient dragon. To stop them, she destroyed all the islands around and for a long time looked for a way to close the portal forever. Alas, she found nothing. The exhausted Zarus could only use the last spell. It tied her and all her descendants to this place, dooming to the eternal protection of the portal from everyone who tries to enter this world. The spell and the destroyed portal did not completely protect the world from the influence of the Ancient Dragon. He could still discreetly follow the dragons born from his bones and gain some of their experience from the Star Mark. \n\n■ Many years later. Tress realized a lot about what he had done, but now all he could do was watch.\n",

 "chapter.1.quest.41.description.1": "\n■ At the beginning of their journey, without knowledge about the proper incubation of eggs, cave dragons would leave them at the bottom of lava lakes, but the newborn dragons were simply disappearing into these vast lakes and no one else could find them. It is assumed that they became feral and mindless monsters that have nothing to do with real cave dragons.\n\n■ In addition to castles, cave dragons were united by danger. In the caves, you can stay under the rubble forever without being able to move. Such poor souls can only hope that they will be found before the lava inside has time to cool off and solidify. It was not pleasant enough to spend the rest of your life as a living statue. For this reason, all cave dragons always try to find a group and do not feel well alone. The need for a family is so strong in them that even altar-turned dragons, despite the danger in the form of water, try to live in the upper world just to be next to other dragons.\n\n■ Most families are formed in a childhood and loners are extremely rare. Like any dragon, they can store an egg inside themselves, but everyone prefers to give it to the Guardians common nest. After hatching, newborn cave dragons look like a living piece of lava. Gradually, they are covered with the first layer of skin of the solidified lava and begin to communicate with other dragons. There have been cases when two newborn dragons were too involved in games and became a dragon with one body but two heads. It was impossible to separate them and the older dragons tried to prevent this from happening. To do this, newborn dragons were isolated before the first skin appeared. Usually it took 1-2 days and did not affect their further sociability. After adaptation, the grown-up dragons were returned to their parents, who supplied them with netherite and taught them about work in caves and customs. The Guardians also had common nursery for those who did not have the opportunity to raise offspring on their own.\n",

 "chapter.1.quest.42.description.1": "\n■ The communities of sea dragons are very different, but most of them are engaged in joint cultivation of food, research and construction. The villagers of the oceans are used to communicating at a fairly large distance and rarely come closely. Their relationship building is complex and not fixated around large families. Sea dragons can be friends for a long time and not form a couple. Even if two dragons never met, they will behave rather as friends, jumping out of the water and greeting each other by flapping their wings. They also easily break up without conflict, if they understand that they are hard in each others company. From the part it may even seem that these underwater brothers have a rampant lifestyle, but it is not. They appreciate every sea dragon around and are not isolating inside the family, as they do, for example, cave dragons.\n\n■ You can often see the sea dragons floating along with a large pearl in the hind legs. This is their egg. It can be of a variety of colors, but the most common is white. In their early days, sea dragons didnt understand how to raise offspring well enough due to a lack of experience and other dragons in principle. The pearl was hard to create, it attracted a lot of attention and significantly depleted the magical forces if it was near. They began to observe other sea creatures and hid many small eggs in all sorts of ocean corners, leaving those on the mercy of fate. As you can guess, it was not effective and over time some of the dragons began to keep an egg with themselves. It was then that the pearls became big and almost every young dragon grew next to one of the parents. They actively communicate with each other and play a lot, making their first attempts to get to the land at an older age. There they explore the world and collect new resources. If you see a large cluster of sea dragons, it will most likely be young ones.\n",

 "chapter.1.quest.44.description.1": "\n■ Many forest dragons are born hunters, capable of defeating even the strongest monsters single-handedly. This is highly prized among other dragons, and they are willing to trade the war trophies of forest dragons for diamonds, for which light-loving brethren are not very fond of going down into caves. Experienced dragons often return to a common den with large prey and show it to other dragons, receiving much praise and attention. Both males and females can do this, forming temporary pairs with particularly successful hunters to raise small forest dragons. They find sunny glades with plenty of moss and plant thorny bushes around it. Then they guard the territory together, get food, and help each other produce venom faster by stroking their partners throat and neck with their horns before hunting. Newborn forest dragons at the beginning have no vegetation on their bodies and are completely defenseless. Parents and other dragons help the right plants take root in the dragon, and all weeds are removed before they become part of the dragon. Forest dragons grown without adult care and have a lot or no venom, but are much better at camouflaging themselves in the area where they were born. They can become wandering loners. Some create families with sea dragons. This rarely works out well, but at least theyre happy enough with each other for a while. \n\n■ When the newborn becomes independent enough, the family returns to the common den. This is where the dragon seeks out a teacher who will take him with him on his travels and show him in practice how to apply his hunting skills. Not all forest dragons become hunters. More and more often you can find those who grow food rather than run after it. Preferring farming, dragons live in spacious, sunny meadows separate from their fellow hunters. Their lairs can be easily recognized by the huge number of sweet berries, which as a living fence protect the area from uninvited guests. Hunting dragons have a skeptical attitude toward such automation and its taste, but in general no one hinders such a development and is even actively interested.\n",
